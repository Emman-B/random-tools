# Random Tools - Tools for Random Number Generation

These are some tools for generating random numbers. It uses Javascript's built-in <code>Math.random()</code> function for generating random numbers, which also means that the randomly generated numbers are not cryptographically secure and shouldn't be used for anything related to security.
